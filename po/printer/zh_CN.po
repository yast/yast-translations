#. Skip automated queue setup when the cupsd is not accessible up to now.
#. A special case is when the cupsd does not listen on the official IANA IPP port (631).

#. "lpstat -h localhost -r" which fails ("-h localhost:port" would have to be used).
#. The YaST printer module does not support when the cupsd listens on a non-official port

#. Usually the id in the connection items is the matching index number in the connections list.
#. Here the id of the current connection is set to -1 because the uri of the current connection
#. is derived from the queues list and this uri may be not present in the connections list
#. for example when the queue has a special non-autodetectable DeviceURI (e.g. for iPrint)
#. or when the queue is for an USB printer which is currently not connected (e.g. a laptop user).
#. Therefore -1 (which means "invalid index number in the connections list") is used to be safe
#. and additionally -1 is used to distinguish when the current connection is kept
#. or when the connection was modified (then the id would be > 0 and valid in the connections list).

"The issue is complicated.\n"
"It is recommended to avoid reserved characters and spaces\n"
"for component values in URIs if the values are under your control\n"
"(e.g. you cannot avoid it when you must specify such characters\n"
"in values for an URI to access a remote print queue\n"
"but the remote print queue is not under your control).\n"
"Whenever possible use only so called 'unreserved characters'.\n"
"Unreserved characters are uppercase and lowercase letters,\n"
"decimal digits, hyphen, period, underscore, and tilde.\n"
"Even hyphen, period, tilde, and case sensitivity\n"
"could cause special issues in special cases\n"
"(e.g. only letters, digits, and underscore are known to work\n"
"for a CUPS print queue name and case is not significant there).\n"
"Therefore it is best to use only lowercase letters, digits,\n"
"and underscore for all values in all URIs if possible.<br>\n"
"Reserved characters and space characters in the value of a component\n"
"must be percent-encoded (also known as URL encoding).<br>\n"
"When an input field in the dialog is intended to enter\n"
"only a single value for a single component of the URI\n"
"(e.g. separated input fields for username and password),\n"
"you must enter spaces and reserved characters literally\n"
"(i.e. non-percent-encoded).\n"
"For such input fields all spaces and reserved characters\n"
"will be automatically percent-encoded.\n"
"For example if a password is actually 'Foo%20Bar' (non-percent-encoded),\n"
"it must be entered literally in the password input field in the dialog.\n"

"the value of the password component is actually stored in the URI.<br>\n"
"In contrast when an input field in the dialog is intended to enter\n"
"more that a single value for a single component of the URI\n"

"like 'option1=value1&amp;option2=value2&amp;option3=value3'\n"
"or a single input field to enter the whole URI),\n"
"you must enter spaces and reserved characters percent-encoded\n"

#. Skip automated queue setup when the cupsd is not accessible up to now.

#. "lpstat -h localhost -r" which fails ("-h localhost:port" would have to be used).
#. The YaST printer module does not support when the cupsd listens on a non-official port

"The issue is complicated.\n"
"It is recommended to avoid reserved characters and spaces\n"

"(e.g. you cannot avoid it when you must specify such characters\n"
"in values for an URI to access a remote print queue\n"
"but the remote print queue is not under your control).\n"
"Whenever possible use only so called 'unreserved characters'.\n"
"Unreserved characters are uppercase and lowercase letters,\n"
"decimal digits, hyphen, period, underscore, and tilde.\n"

"could cause special issues in special cases\n"
"(e.g. only letters, digits, and underscore are known to work\n"
"for a CUPS print queue name and case is not significant there).\n"
"Therefore it is best to use only lowercase letters, digits,\n"
"and underscore for all values in all URIs if possible.<br>\n"
"Reserved characters and space characters in the value of a component\n"
"must be percent-encoded (also known as URL encoding).<br>\n"
"When an input field in the dialog is intended to enter\n"
"only a single value for a single component of the URI\n"
"(e.g. separated input fields for username and password),\n"
"you must enter spaces and reserved characters literally\n"
"(i.e. non-percent-encoded).\n"
"For such input fields all spaces and reserved characters\n"
"will be automatically percent-encoded.\n"
"For example if a password is actually 'Foo%20Bar' (non-percent-encoded),\n"

"the value of the password component is actually stored in the URI.<br>\n"
"In contrast when an input field in the dialog is intended to enter\n"
"more that a single value for a single component of the URI\n"

"like 'option1=value1&amp;option2=value2&amp;option3=value3'\n"
"or a single input field to enter the whole URI),\n"
"you must enter spaces and reserved characters percent-encoded\n"
"because an automated percent-encoding is no longer possible.\n"
"Assume in an optional parameter 'option=value'\n"
"the value would be 'this&amp;that' so that the whole\n"

#. it seems something went wrong with the testpage printing
#. so that the user can delete all pending jobs now.
#. Via the "cancel" command the cupsd sends termination signals
#. to running filter processes for the queue so that the filters
#. (in particular the printer driver) could do whatever is needed
#. to switch an actively printing printer device into a clean state
#. (e.g. exit its graphics printing mode and switch back to normal mode).
#. The backend process terminates when the filters have finished.
#. This helps in usual cases (in particular when a good driver is used)
#. if something had messed up for an actively printing job but
#. unfortunately there is no option for the "cancel" command
#. which lets the cupsd kill the backend process as emergency brake
#. when something is really wrong e.g. a wrong driver lets the printer
#. spit out zillions of sheets with nonsense characters.
#. When this command fails for whatever reason, it is a safe fallback
#. to assume that there are no pending jobs in the queue:

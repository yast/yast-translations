"Unreserved characters are uppercase and lowercase letters,\n"

"could cause special issues in special cases\n"
"(e.g. only letters, digits, and underscore are known to work\n"

"Therefore it is best to use only lowercase letters, digits,\n"
"and underscore for all values in all URIs if possible.<br>\n"
"Reserved characters and space characters in the value of a component\n"
"must be percent-encoded (also known as URL encoding).<br>\n"

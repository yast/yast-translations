#. or when the queue is for an USB printer which is currently not connected (e.g. a laptop user).
#. Therefore -1 (which means "invalid index number in the connections list") is used to be safe

#. it seems something went wrong with the testpage printing
#. so that the user can delete all pending jobs now.
#. Via the "cancel" command the cupsd sends termination signals
#. to running filter processes for the queue so that the filters
#. (in particular the printer driver) could do whatever is needed
#. to switch an actively printing printer device into a clean state
#. (e.g. exit its graphics printing mode and switch back to normal mode).
#. The backend process terminates when the filters have finished.
#. This helps in usual cases (in particular when a good driver is used)
#. if something had messed up for an actively printing job but
#. unfortunately there is no option for the "cancel" command
#. which lets the cupsd kill the backend process as emergency brake
#. when something is really wrong e.g. a wrong driver lets the printer
#. spit out zillions of sheets with nonsense characters.

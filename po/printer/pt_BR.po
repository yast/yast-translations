#. or when the queue is for an USB printer which is currently not connected (e.g. a laptop user).
#. Therefore -1 (which means "invalid index number in the connections list") is used to be safe

"It is recommended to avoid reserved characters and spaces\n"

"in values for an URI to access a remote print queue\n"
"but the remote print queue is not under your control).\n"
"Whenever possible use only so called 'unreserved characters'.\n"
"Unreserved characters are uppercase and lowercase letters,\n"

"could cause special issues in special cases\n"
"(e.g. only letters, digits, and underscore are known to work\n"
"for a CUPS print queue name and case is not significant there).\n"
"Therefore it is best to use only lowercase letters, digits,\n"
"and underscore for all values in all URIs if possible.<br>\n"
"Reserved characters and space characters in the value of a component\n"
"must be percent-encoded (also known as URL encoding).<br>\n"
"When an input field in the dialog is intended to enter\n"
"only a single value for a single component of the URI\n"
"(e.g. separated input fields for username and password),\n"
"you must enter spaces and reserved characters literally\n"

"or a single input field to enter the whole URI),\n"
"you must enter spaces and reserved characters percent-encoded\n"
"because an automated percent-encoding is no longer possible.\n"
"Assume in an optional parameter 'option=value'\n"

#. to switch an actively printing printer device into a clean state
#. (e.g. exit its graphics printing mode and switch back to normal mode).
#. The backend process terminates when the filters have finished.
#. This helps in usual cases (in particular when a good driver is used)
#. if something had messed up for an actively printing job but
#. unfortunately there is no option for the "cancel" command
#. which lets the cupsd kill the backend process as emergency brake

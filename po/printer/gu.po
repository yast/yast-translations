#. Usually the id in the connection items is the matching index number in the connections list.
#. Here the id of the current connection is set to -1 because the uri of the current connection
#. is derived from the queues list and this uri may be not present in the connections list
#. for example when the queue has a special non-autodetectable DeviceURI (e.g. for iPrint)
#. or when the queue is for an USB printer which is currently not connected (e.g. a laptop user).
#. Therefore -1 (which means "invalid index number in the connections list") is used to be safe
#. and additionally -1 is used to distinguish when the current connection is kept
#. or when the connection was modified (then the id would be > 0 and valid in the connections list).

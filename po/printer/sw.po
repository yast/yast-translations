"could cause special issues in special cases\n"

"Therefore it is best to use only lowercase letters, digits,\n"
"and underscore for all values in all URIs if possible.<br>\n"

#. (in particular the printer driver) could do whatever is needed
#. to switch an actively printing printer device into a clean state
#. (e.g. exit its graphics printing mode and switch back to normal mode).
#. The backend process terminates when the filters have finished.
#. This helps in usual cases (in particular when a good driver is used)
#. if something had messed up for an actively printing job but
#. unfortunately there is no option for the "cancel" command
#. which lets the cupsd kill the backend process as emergency brake
#. when something is really wrong e.g. a wrong driver lets the printer
#. spit out zillions of sheets with nonsense characters.

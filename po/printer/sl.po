#. or when the queue is for an USB printer which is currently not connected (e.g. a laptop user).

#. Via the "cancel" command the cupsd sends termination signals
#. to running filter processes for the queue so that the filters
#. (in particular the printer driver) could do whatever is needed
#. to switch an actively printing printer device into a clean state
#. (e.g. exit its graphics printing mode and switch back to normal mode).
#. The backend process terminates when the filters have finished.
#. This helps in usual cases (in particular when a good driver is used)

#. unfortunately there is no option for the "cancel" command
#. which lets the cupsd kill the backend process as emergency brake

#. The most often problem which is reported by users regarding scanner setup is
#. when a driver was set up but then no scanner was recognized by this driver.
#. If the driver is the right one for the scanner, then in very most cases
#. the reason is a low-level (kernel related) device communication problem
#. (i.e. a low-level USB problem or a low-level SCSI problem).
#. Those problems cannot be fixed from within the YaST scanner setup module
#. but at least the user must be informed.
#. Be careful when you change or translate "No scanner recognized by this driver"
#. because exactly this text is shown here to the user in this case.
#. In particular keep the meaning of "recognize" because the driver actually runs
#. but the running driver fails to recognize the scanner.

#. Class to represent all the possible encryption types implemented by libstorage
#.
#. This is the technology used to perform the encryption at low level, as
#. managed by libstorage-ng. Not to be confused with the YaST-specific
#. {EncryptionMethod}, which represents a higher level abstraction.
#.
#. This is a wrapper for the Storage::EncryptionType enum
#.
#. @note Take into account that EncryptionType::LUKS exists only as a legacy
#. alias provided by libstorage-ng for EncryptionType::LUKS1. In general, LUKS
#. should not be used as a constant (use LUKS1 instead) and :luks should not be
#. used as it's symbol counterpart.
#.
#. @example Surprising but correct behaviour of EncryptionType::LUKS
#. # This is what you would expect
#. type = EncryptionType::LUKS1
#. type.to_sym  # => :luks1
#. type.is?(:luks1)  # => true

# All YaST Translations

run tools/update-tool.sh to update pot+po files
This is not needed in normal situation. Changes are merged automatically by Jenkins and update-tool-cron.sh.
It is required:
- After fixing a bug in the tools code.
- When new domain appears.
Note that the tool currently requires ssh access to the weblate server to create new projects or branches.

tools/yast-check-lcn-import.sh can be used to check consistency
